# Quantum Computer Simulator

This project lets you code a quantum computer in your browser using QASM.

It is written in JavaScript and runs in your browser, so you don't have to sign up with a big company, wait in a queue, or spend money to test an experiment.

Just play!

Run it locally (no web server required) or try it out online:
